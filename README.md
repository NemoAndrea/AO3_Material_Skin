# Archive of our own (AO3) Skins - Material Design
This contains css files for material design inspired skins for the website archive of our own. Both light and dark versions will be added here. Various colour schemes wil be available. 

p.s. I do not personally use the website, I created these skins for someone else, as it would be a good first ccs styling exercise. I did learn a good bit about css styling and the chrome webpage inspection tool.
